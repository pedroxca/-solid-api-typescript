## How to install and use

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/pedroxca/-solid-api-typescript
```

Then:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

Almost there!

Now you should configure your `.env` file, which should be located in the `root` path of your application

Then run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

## How to convert it to JavaScript

Since browsers and Node.js can't read Typescript, we have to compile it to JavaScript so servers and browsers can read it too.

To do this run:

```bash
npx tsc
```

or

```bash
yarn tsc
```

Now, you should be good to go! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ
